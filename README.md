# Pipette

Pipette is the WYSIWYG of pipe mods! Simplicity is key!

Pipette only works with items. There are no plans to support fluids or other mods at this time.

Pipette is somewhat efficient, but wasn't designed for large scale server use and may cause unwanted lag for very large amounts of interconnected pipes (in the thousands).

Visit the wiki for information on crafting recipes and usage.
